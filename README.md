Todo:
- AWS EC2/RDS
# All are free (in $$$, maybe not in personal info) to use

## Backend
- [Strapi][3] (very cool, open source headless CMS - [Tutorial][5] for ezpz Reactjs + Strapi Blog)
- [Screen][4] (awesome util to run server amongst other things)

## Deploy
- [One-liner server list][1]
- [Deploy Strapi app on AWS (EC2, RDS & S3)][9]
- [Deploy React app on gh-pages][13]
- [Deploy React app on Netlify][14] ([Or more depht about netlify.toml and further links][15])

## Quality of life
- [Zapier][6] (doing webhooks & stuff in minutes - ez pz)
- [Typeform][7] (doing web form in minutes. sexier than Google Forms. Pairs EXTREMELY well with [Zapier][6] to push form data into an API/whatever - setup max 1h first time, <15mn next times, form creation included)

## Git
- [Replace Master by branch x][10] (One of the most elegant way to 'fix' your awful, dirty, godforsaken gitflow)
- [Delete a remote branch][11] (tl;dr : `git push origin --delete <branch_name>`)
- [Delete a local branch][12] (tl;dr: `git branch -d <branch_name>` , use -D instead to force delete w/o status check)

## Toolboxception
- ['cause I eat *a lot* of vegetables][2]

## Le baguette du fromage (ressources fr_FR)
- [Devenir freelance][8]
