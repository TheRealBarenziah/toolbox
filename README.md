Todo:

# All are free (in $$$, maybe not in personal info) to use

## Reactjs
- [File input wrapper][28] (For more infos about client-side file access [check File API doc][29])

- [Create a Strapi/Koa middleware][23] (nice Medium article about it)
- [Screen][4] (awesome Linux util to run server amongst other things)
- [Node util][25] (native, easy way to say goodbye to "Error: JSON circular reference")
- [Modern/Inline API documentation][32] (Swagger-ui. For a ligher alternative (and personal favorite) check [Apidoc][33])
- [Wordpress .htaccess tricks][36]

## Deploy
- [One-liner server list][1]
- [Deploy Strapi app on AWS (EC2, RDS & S3)][9]

- [Getting started with AssemblyScript][20]

## Quality of life
- [Zapier][6] (doing webhooks & stuff in minutes - ez pz)
- [Typeform][7] (doing web form in minutes. sexier than Google Forms. Pairs EXTREMELY well with [Zapier][6] to push form data into an API/whatever - setup max 1h first time, <15mn next times, form creation included)
- [npm i async-foreach][27] (For each forEach, this module save a lot of time (unless writing tons of `new Promise()` turns you on)
- [Password generator][37]

## Git
- [Replace Master by branch x][10] (One of the most elegant way to 'fix' your awful, dirty, godforsaken gitflow)
- [Delete a remote branch][11] (tl;dr : `git push origin --delete <branch_name>`)
- [Delete a local branch][12] (tl;dr: `git branch -d <branch_name>` , use -D instead to force delete w/o status check)
- [Update a forked repo with current version][21] (no tl;dr: the link is 10 lines long, straight to the point)
- [Formating a sweet README with banners and all][30]

## Toolboxception
- [Eating a lot of vegetables][2]
